Performance enhancements:
  - DO CONCURRENT
     - R818.f90
  - CONTIGUOUS
     - R502.f08

Data declaration:
  - allocatable component can be of recursive type
  - name constant array's shape can be implied by its value
  - a pointer can be initially associated with a target
  - subscripts and nested implied-do limits inside a data-implied-do can be any constant expression
  - FORALL index can have its type and kind explicitly declared within the construct
  - TYPE can be used to declare entities of intrinsic type
     - R403.f90
  - multiple type-bound procedures can be declared in a single type-bound procedure statement
     - 4.5.5

Data usage and computation:
  - a structure constructor can omit the value for an allocatable component
  - SOURCE= in ALLOCATE statement can give array bounds as well as the value
  - MOLD= in ALLOCATE statement can give polymorphic variable the shape, type, and type parameters
  - real and imaginary parts of a complex entity can be accessed with component-like syntax
     - R615.f90
  - intrinsic assignment to an allocatable polymorphic variable is allowed
  - a pointer function reference can denote a variable in any variable definition context
  - some restricetions on the use of dummy arguments in elemental subprograms have been removed

Input/output:
  - NEWUNIT= in OPEN
  - G0 edit descriptor and unlimited format control for CSV format
  - recursive data transfers are allowed on distinct units

Execution control:
  - BLOCK construct
     - R807.f90, R808.f90
  - EXIT can transfer control from more named executable constructs
  - STOP has been changed to accept a constant expression rather than merely a literal constant
     - R855.f90
  - ERROR STOP initiates error termination
     - R856.f90

Intrinsic procedures:

Intrinsic modules:

Program and procedures:
  - empty CONTAINS allowed
     - empty_contains.{f90,f90.no-diff}
  - internal procedure can be used as an actual argument or procedure pointer target
  - ALLOCATABLE and POINTER attributes used in generic resolution
  - procedureness of a dummy argument used in generic resolution
  - actual argument with TARGET atribute can correspond to a dummy pointer
  - a null pointer or unallocated allocatable can be used to denote absence of optional argument
  - impure elemental procedure processes array arguments in array element order
  - FUNCTION and SUBROUTINE keywords can be omitted from the END statement for a module or internal subprogram
     - end_statements.{f90,f90.no-diff}
  - a line in a program is permitted to begin with a semicolon
     - semicolon.{f90,f90.no-diff}
