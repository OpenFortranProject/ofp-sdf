Create the traversal with the command:

     make check-pp > sage-aterm-traverse.C

The generated grammar file should be in the ROSE build tree at:

    /Users/rasmus/ROSE/build_rose-develop/src/ROSETTA/src/generated_sdf_tree_grammar.rtg

I think I was able to create this file the last time I tried to build ROSE on my Mac Pro.
Even though the build was not entirely successful (failed on EDG stuff as I recall), 
apparently it was able to get far enough to create the required grammar file.
Unfortunately, the latest attempt at building ROSE failed in Boost land (or at lost
generated lots of Boost errors).
